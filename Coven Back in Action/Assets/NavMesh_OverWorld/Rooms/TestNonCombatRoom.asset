  description: "\tApproaching the building a heavy sense of dread fell over the Command
    Center. Death and decay awaited the team on the other side. Horrors that only
    a select few could say they know of and fewer still could say they truly understood.
    All the while the ones chosen to be sent in are experimental creations only one
    man knew the secret to. \n\n\tNo one was certain what the outcome would be, the
    Homunculi however, stood fast, whether it was bravery, some kind of natural affinity
    to this kind of environment or their newly created minds naivete, they waited
    patiently for the order to enter into the building."
