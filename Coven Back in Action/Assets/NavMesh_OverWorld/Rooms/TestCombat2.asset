  description: "\tAs they stepped through the doors, the Homunculi spotted many horrible,
    mutated figures limping about in the darkened lobby. As the doors creaked shut
    behind them, the closest of the creatures turned slowly to face them and let
    out an earsplitting shriek.\n\n\tAs all the other monstrous beings in the room
    began to turn in their direction, the homunculi wordlessly drew their weapons
    and prepared for battle."
