  description: "\tVictorious over the creatures in the lobby, the Homunculi press
    forward into the dark and cluttered back hallways of the Sanitorium. Even more
    horribly mutated ex-humans waited for them. One Homunculus briefly wondered what
    the point of all this was, before reassuring herself that wondering about her
    job was not her job, killing these things was her job. And so another bloody
    fight commenced."
